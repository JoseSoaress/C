# SpongeBob - Inverted pendulum project

This was done for a university project. The idea was to construct a natural instable robot that 
would try to keep the balance using controle tecnices. In this project the following hardware was
used Arduino Mega 2560, 2 12V DC motors, 1 H bridge, aultra-sound sensor, a bluetooth module (HC-06),
a giroscope&accelarometer module (MPU650), and 2 bateries.
A small app was developed that would send moving signals by bluetooth.

In the gif below the robot was evading the obstacle while maintaining the balance.

Here the robot goes back to the initial positioning while maintaning balance.

Below we have a small clip of the robot receiving inputs from the app that we develop.
This was not the main focus of the project, just a proof of concept.
